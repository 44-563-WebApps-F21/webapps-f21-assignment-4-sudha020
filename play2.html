   <p class="GUIDO speech">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
    That I am some great Lord of Italy,
    And we will have long days of joy together.
    Within the hour, dear Ascanio.</p>

     <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ ASCANIO.]</p>                                                    

   <p class="GUIDO speech">Now tell me of my father?</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Sits down on a stone seat_.]</p>
   <p class="GUIDO speech">Stood he tall?
    I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.
    His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,
    Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?
    The very bravest men have voices sometimes
    Full of low music; or a clarion was it
    That brake with terror all his enemies?
    Did he ride singly? or with many squires
    And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?
    For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins
    Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?</p>

<h6 class="MORANZONE name">MORANZONE</h6>

   <p class="MORANZONE speech">Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.</p>

<h6 class="GUIDO name">GUIDO</h6> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_proudly_]</p>

   <p class="GUIDO speech">Then when you saw my noble father last
    He was set high above the heads of men?</p>
